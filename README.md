Library Management System
This project is a Library Management System designed to efficiently manage a library’s collection of books, authors, and members. The system supports essential operations like adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving information about books, authors, and members. Additionally, it includes features to track the borrowing and returning of books.
The project is built using Clean Architecture principles and adheres to separation of concerns across layers: Application, Domain, Infrastructure, and Presentation. The architecture ensures flexibility, scalability, and maintainability, making it easy to extend and test.
